# AMATI-Bot

This repository contains all code to run the Slack bot for AMATI.        

## Configuration

The bot can be configured by providing a 'config.properties' file. A sample for this can be seen in the [./sample-config.properties](sample file). 
A tutorial on how to generate the Slack API tokens can be found [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/215770388-create-and-regenerate-api-tokens).]

The bot needs to be started after the AMATI-Backend for a stable websocket connection. Make sure to only run one instance to avoid Slack API limitations.

## Commands

The commands for the bot can be found in the publicly available gist [here](https://gist.github.com/kajo404/fe41a18c7e04a72e990f7930cc089c23).
